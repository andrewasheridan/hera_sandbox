        Downsampling binary classifier
        CNN: Convolutional Neural Network.
        DS: DownSampling. Each convolution is followed by a downsampling convolution
        BN: All non-linearalities have batch-normalization applied.
        BC: Binary Classification, this network classifies samples of having one of two labels.
 
        Each layer starts with a 1x3 convolution with 2**i filters (i = layer index) with stride of 1.
        This is fed into a 1x5 convolution with the same number of filters, but stride of 2 (50% downsample)

        Leaky_ReLU and batch normalization is applied after each convolution. Downsamples convolutions have dropout.
        Biases are added before activations.

        Output of last layer is fed to fully connected layer (with no activation)

        Cost function is softmax cross entropy
